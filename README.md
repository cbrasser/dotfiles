# dotfiles

This repo contains all relevant dotfiles for my current arch linux/bspwm setup.

The top bar is a custom polybar configuration. My terminal is terminator, running fish shell (through zsh atm). My text editor is neovim with plugins for python development. The pipe script running in the terminal is [pipes.sh](https://github.com/pipeseroni/pipes.sh) and the binary clock is [peaclock](https://github.com/octobanana/peaclock).
